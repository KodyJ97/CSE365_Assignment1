Update 1.1: Changed entire program based off helper function. This is due to the difficult access to file storage and haveing to constantly reparse
the storage fiel to have what I want.
Update 1.2: Teacher extends due date but some commands have changed as result code is being changed alot.
Update 1.3: Teacher extends due date again this project is becoming to be a time consumer.
